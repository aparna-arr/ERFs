== Notes ==
* mapwigtobed runs finished
* simulation is still running ... probably need to rewrite some of metaplot so it is more efficient / does threading

arrajpur@crick:~/github/metaplot_Cpp$ mkdir threading

* Pushed VERSION 0.2 of metaplot
* threading is going to be intense

arrajpur@crick:~/github/metaplot_Cpp/threading$ touch UserOptsThread.cpp UserOptsThread.h ChromosomeThread.h ChromosomeThread.cpp MetaplotThread.cpp MetaplotThread.h MetaplotRegionThread.cpp MetaplotRegionThread.h
