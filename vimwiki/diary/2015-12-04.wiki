== Notes ==
* Finished PCA/LDA analysis + clustering, need significance test.
* Working on pol2 pausing
* using ratio/calculation from http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v39/n12/full/ng.2007.26.html (see supplemental)
* Basically, take the max signal at the TSS, divide by median signal over gene body

* Define promoter as +- 750 bp (1500 bp total: from observation when making pol2 model) The paper uses a much smaller boundary
* eliminate all genes < 1500 bp
* eliminate all genes with an antisense gene
* select only the longest transcript for each gene
* Bins: 10bp or as limited by wig file bins
* minimum genebody count is 1 (pseudocount) so we don't have to check before dividing
* the closer the ratio is to the max_signal, the more poised the pol2 is at that gene
* assign gene a % of poised-ness
* (TSS_max / Genebody_median ) / TSS_max * 100
* does this make sense? print out ratio and this percentage
* The ratio should always be + and should never be 1! If it is 1, then genebody_median == TSS_max which makes no sense and does NOT show a summit at TSS
* To solve this problem, the paper used only pol2 which showed enrichment over a random background using a microarray-specific model
* I don't know how i will solve this but I guess I can just do ratio first and see what I get
* Should I do C++? ...no
* another problem: if no pol2 at a gene, the ratio can get really messed up
* Maybe run another pol2 specific peak caller and throw out all genes -v
* I really have to make a perl module ...

* wrote script 
`arrajpur@crick:~/processing/pol2_poised$ ./pol2_poised_index.pl `

`arrajpur@crick:~/processing/pol2_poised$ cp ~/processing/yH2AX/mm9_clean_genes.bed .`

* script is really slow so I wrote a script to split the genes file into chrs so I can run all chrs parallel

`arrajpur@crick:~/processing/pol2_poised$ ./split_bed_by_chrs.pl mm9_clean_genes.bed `

`arrajpur@crick:~/processing/pol2_poised$ mkdir chrs`
`arrajpur@crick:~/processing/pol2_poised$ mv chr*bed chrs/`
`# arrajpur@crick:~/processing/pol2_poised$ ./pol2_poised_index.pl mm9_clean_genes.bed ~/histone/wigs/polII.wig 100 1500 test.txt`

`arrajpur@crick:~/processing/pol2_poised$ for f in chrs/* ; do srun -p bigmemh ./pol2_poised_index.pl $f ~/histone/wigs/polII.wig 100 1500 $f.out & ; done`

* okay I optimized it (never dereference and assign wigs in subroutines! Use refs!)
* but I discovered that the pol2 wig is enrichment ONLY over SICER peaks! WHY
* Sicer is a horrible alg choice for pol2 peak calling
* they are prob trying to hide the quality of their chip
* also all my ratios are huge. going to add a pseudocount.
