* Okay so what to do about the AltERFs blacklist problem:
* I get to repeat all analysis yay!
* This sucks
* First do a diff against the supposedly blacklist-free AltERFs. Then write a bash script to do all the analysis for me
* said bash script should launch a bunch of screened sruns for maximum parallelization
* Also make a ton of metaplots with this script
* figure out how to save all these plots in a multi-page pdf
* use `print(ggplot(...))` to make it work
* `height=5 width=25` appears to work well
