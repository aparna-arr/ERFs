`usage: <output of pol2_poised_index.pl for genes (6 col)> <output of bedtools intersect -wo -a erfs (3 col) -b genes (4 col)> <outfile>`

* to integrate genes poised data with erfs

* output file represents the % of genes overlapped by the ERF OF THOSE WITH POL2, what % are in each poisedness bin
* Those genes which have high poisedness: what is their RNAseq?
* ERFS: First: do those erfs w/ high poisedness of genes have more or fewer genes?
* What marks do those genes with high poisedness associate with vs those with low poisedness? (biggest percentage in bin 3 vs bin 0 == high poisedness)
