= Lab Notes 09.09.15 =

== To Do ==
- [X] Clean up genome browser session
- [ ] Determine RPA peaks (NOT the same as ERFs)
- [ ] Update graphical lab notebook
- [X] Start looking at metaplot script
- [ ] Make ppt with ERF statistics 

== Notes == 

* I should probably -v -a peaksplit -b blacklist before calling these the final ERFs
* yH2AX is not very clean but that's expected
* Corr plots time ... both AID only against each other, both 53BP1 against eachother, etc. Make matrix of corr plots.

`arrajpur@crick:~$ bedtools makewindows -g processing/binning/mm9.chrom -w 10000 | awk '{print $1 "\t" $2 "\t" $3 "\t" NR}' > windows_10k.bed`

* Using Stella's script to count reads instead of htseq-count

`arrajpur@crick:~/processing/yH2AX$ srun -p bigmemm perl -I /home/mitochi/bin/ /home/mitochi/bin/CountSAM2BED.pl ~/windows_10k.bed ../sam/AID_tr.txt.trim.sam`
